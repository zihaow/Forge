—————————————————————————————————————

Giant item mod, which makes items giant. //Contains junit test cases for this mod.

test folder, which contains all junit test file for our project.

net folder, which contains NPCs we will create in the future.

texture folder, which contains NPCs’ images that we want to make it look like.

Only /src, /eclipse, and /config, /texture under eclipse folders are necessary for our Minecraft Forge.

So simply copy these folders to a installed Minecraft Forge then it can be run successfully.
