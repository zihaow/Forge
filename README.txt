Installation
—————————————————————————————————————

Only /src, /eclipse, /config, /assets and /texture under eclipse folders are necessary for our Minecraft Forge.

So simply copy these folders to a installed Minecraft Forge then it can be run successfully.

If eclipse cannot open the project, Just run “./gradlew eclipse” and then the problem will be solved.

Sometimes eclipse will show some error messages when we try to run the program, just ignore the error message and click “Proceed” bottom. The program can running very well.
